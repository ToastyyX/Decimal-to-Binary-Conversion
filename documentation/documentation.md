## _Introduction & Purpose_ :
<p class="set-font-normal">
    The purpose of this program is to allow a user to quickly obtain
        the binary value of almost any decimal number. The program primarily
        works by utilizing the stack data structure. The program also includes
        new methods that are specifically made for the output of this program and its context.
        This project is ultimately supposed to help me experiment more with Java 
        and also as a useful way for me calculate the binary value of almost any decimal number QUICKLY.
        Not too long ago, I was actually doing this same process before but by hand, paper and pencil.
        This is a basic program, but I hope it can be useful to you and someone else as well.

## _Methods_ :
